Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,

I saw that it has been three days since you last journaled.

Building a new habit is hard. It took me months to get in to the habit. I look at 
habits as rocket launches:

On launch, there is a strong gravity pull. It takes a lot of energy to pull away. 
But once you enter space, you just float and it takes less energy to move.

Push through the first phase by starting small. Simply focus on writing only a few
sentences a day. No pressure. 

Reply to this email if you have a question! :)

Cheers!

Thierry
