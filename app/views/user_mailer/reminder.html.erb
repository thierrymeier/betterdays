  Hey <%= @user.first_name %>,
</p>

<p>
  I saw that it has been three days since you last journaled.
</p>

<p>
  Building a new habit is hard. It took me months to get in to the habit. I look at 
  habits as rocket launches:
</p>

<p>
  On launch, there is a strong gravity pull. It takes a lot of energy to pull away. 
  But once you enter space, you just float and it takes less energy to move.
</p>

<p>
  Push through the first phase by starting small. Simply focus on writing only a few
  sentences a day. No pressure.
