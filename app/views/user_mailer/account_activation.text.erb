Hello <%= @user.first_name %>!

This is Thierry from Better Days. Thank you so much for joining. I am excited 
to get journaling together!

I think it is great that you have decided to start journaling. If you ask me, it
is one of the most beneficial habits you can implement into your life.
  
Let me point out why:

..it forces you to live consciously
..it enhances your creativity by creating something on a daily basis.
..it generates clarity and congruence
..it clears and calms your emotions
..it increases your gratitude
..it unfolds the writer in you by writing every day

Unwinding after a busy day and sorting your thoughts and bringing them down to
paper has been so valuable to me.

Ultimately, you'll feel more in touch with yourself, your feelings, your goals 
and ambitions.

Socrates said that the unexamined life is not worth living. I fully agree.
