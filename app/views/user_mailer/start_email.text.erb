now that you have activated the account you can get started.

Let me give you a few tips that have helped me greatly to implement the habit of
journaling every day:

Start small
In the beginning, simply start with writing a couple of sentences every day. It is
not the volume that counts, but the process of reflection. If you feel like it,
you can go more in-depth later.

Set up a time
I personally journal right before I go to bed to unwind. It helps me to calm
my monkey mind by reflecting and writing everything down.

Set a timer or reminder
A reminder goes off every evening at around 10pm. It is usually when I head to 
bed and stay away from things that stimulate my mind too much.

Do it consistently
Journal every day, even if it is just a few sentences, like this, you're on the 
fast track to building the habit. 

That's it. If you take away one thing from this email, it is to smart small. 
The idea of sitting down and journal should be something to look forward to.

But now, I'll let you go ahead and write away.

As mentioned, I'll check-in with you personally in a few days to see how it is going.

Stay creative!
